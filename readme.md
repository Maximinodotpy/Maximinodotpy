Hi, my name is Maxim Maeder, I am a young programming enthusiast looking to have fun coding and teaching you some things about programming. 

I master several programming languages like Python, PHP and JavaScript I also know how to make websites with HTML and CSS. Sometimes I even try to make games with the Godot Game Engine. But I always return to my first language python, and that is why I love making tutorials about them. I hope you learn something from my words and have as much fun as I do when programming!

I write programming articles for [The Python Code](https://www.thepythoncode.com/author/maxim-maeder) and my own [Blog](https://maximmaeder.com). I have learned a lot from making these Tutorials and I am happy that some people learned something from me.

If you want to contact me just message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Maximin51028473) or even better you can write me an [E-Mail](mailto:info@maximmaeder.ch).
